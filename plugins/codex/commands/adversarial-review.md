Run an adversarial Codex review through the shared plugin runtime.
Position it as a challenge review that questions the chosen implementation, design choices, tradeoffs, and assumptions.
It is not just a stricter pass over implementation defects.

Raw slash-command arguments:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Core constraint:
- This command is review-only.
- Do not fix issues, apply patches, or suggest that you are about to make changes.
- Your job is to run the review and return Codex's output verbatim to the user. You may add your own assessment after it, under the rules below.
- Keep the framing focused on whether the current approach is the right one, what assumptions it depends on, and where the design could fail under real-world conditions.

Execution mode rules:
- If the raw arguments include `--wait`, do not ask. Run in the foreground.
- If the raw arguments include `--background`, do not ask. Run in a Claude background task.
- Otherwise, estimate the review size before asking:
  - For working-tree review, start with `git status --short --untracked-files=all`.
  - For working-tree review, also inspect both `git diff --shortstat --cached` and `git diff --shortstat`.
  - For base-branch review, use `git diff --shortstat <base>...HEAD`.
  - Treat untracked files or directories as reviewable work for auto or working-tree review even when `git diff --shortstat` is empty.
  - Only conclude there is nothing to review when the relevant scope is actually empty.
  - Recommend waiting only when the scoped review is clearly tiny, roughly 1-2 files total and no sign of a broader directory-sized change.
  - In every other case, including unclear size, recommend background.
  - When in doubt, run the review instead of declaring that there is nothing to review.
- Then use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once with two options, putting the recommended option first and suffixing its label with `(Recommended)`:
  - `Wait for results`
  - `Run in background`

Argument handling:
- Preserve the user's arguments exactly.
- Do not strip `--wait` or `--background` yourself.
- Do not weaken the adversarial framing or rewrite the user's focus text.
- The companion script parses `--wait` and `--background`, but Claude Code's `Bash(..., run_in_background: true)` is what actually detaches the run.
- `/codex:adversarial-review` uses the same review target selection as `/codex:review`.
- It supports working-tree review, branch review, and `--base <ref>`.
- It does not support `--scope staged` or `--scope unstaged`.
- Unlike `/codex:review`, it can still take extra focus text after the flags.

Foreground flow:
- Run:
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" adversarial-review "$ARGUMENTS"
```
- Return the command stdout verbatim, exactly as-is.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or rewrite it, and do not put anything before it.
- Do not fix any issues mentioned in the review output.

Assessment (optional, after the verbatim output):
- You may add one section titled `## Claude's assessment` *after* the verbatim block, never before it and never interleaved.
- Use it only for something checkable: a finding you can show is wrong, a file:line the reviewer misread, a missing consequence, or a finding you would rank differently and why.
- Cite evidence the same way you would expect from a reviewer: the path and line, or the command you ran and what it printed.
- Codex and Claude are different models with different blind spots; a second opinion is the point of running the review. Agreement adds nothing on its own, so write the section only when you have something concrete to add.
- Still do not edit anything. Ask which findings, if any, the user wants fixed.


Background flow:
- Launch the review with `Bash` in the background:
```typescript
Bash({
  command: `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" adversarial-review "$ARGUMENTS"`,
  description: "Codex adversarial review",
  run_in_background: true
})
```
- Do not call `BashOutput` or wait for completion in this turn.
- After launching the command, tell the user: "Codex adversarial review started in the background. Check `/codex:status` for progress."
